# RustAutoClicker

Just as the name potrays it,a simple and a bit restrictive autocliker made with rust.To use the user can specify the path and then the programm will execute the path.

The app was made using the [enigo crate](https://docs.rs/enigo/latest/enigo/).The autoclicker was made primarly because I wanted to make the grind for pokemon much easier that why there's the pokemon mode
